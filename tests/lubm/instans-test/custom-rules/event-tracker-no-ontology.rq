# Event tracker - no static data

# Tracks the changing of events/windows in the main input and updates
# input redirection accordingly.

# Specialized for the LUBM benchmark, each department represents an "event"
# This version is for queries without reasoning support, i.e. there is no static data to be kept in memory.
